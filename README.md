##### Zappa and Elastic Beanstalk

This repo includes step by step instructions for setting up [Sal](https://github.com/salopensource/sal) with [Zappa](www.zappa.io) and [Munkireport-php](https://github.com/munkireport/munkireport-php) with [Elastic Beanstalk](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html
). It's meant to compliment my talk from [MacDevOpsYVR](https://macdevops.ca/presentations) 2017.
